* Open the solution
* Right click on the Documentation project and choose build.
* Index.html and other html pages will be generated to the \Documentation\Doxygen\HTML directory.

Using NSF
=========
NSF is a framework contained in a .lib for inclusion in projects that require state machine behavior.  To start using  NSF, link against the NorthStateFramework.lib within your project.  See the included examples.  For an in-depth tutorial on using NSF, see the WorkingWithNorthStateFramework document contained in the solution.
